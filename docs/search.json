    "text": "This is the first post in a Quarto blog. Welcome!\n\nI created this blog on the 8th of June 2024 (circa 2 AM) after ending a Monthly Friday vigil. I have had this thought of creating a blog during the week to express my thoughts about things, especially science. So, I got inspiration reading Meghan Hall’s post how she switched to Quarto. That’s how I read a few posts, including Philipp’s and watched a few YT videos on how to get started although I had once started a website with Quarto but abandoned it and I have a Google site website already. This is just for blogging and journaling."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Independence! Independence!! Independence!!!. This day marks another epoch of national liberty in which the nationals rejoice in their freedom from their colonial master. When we talk about freedom, we mean total freedom. Consider an inmate who has stayed in the lock for decades and suddenly gains his freedom; you will say he is free because he will no longer remain in that bondage. Yes, as a nation, we’ve got freedom, but it is not total freedom. If you look well, you will see the total depravity and moral decadency around you with no law that firmly holds against them. Now to be specific, look at yourself, have you also gotten your freedom? I mean, are you free from sins? Has Christ’s atoning blood cleansed you from sins’ stains?. ‘And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free - John 8:32’. It is the truth that can make you free and not any ‘ritual’ or ‘ablution’. So as long as you commit sin, you are a servant of sin and colonized by sin.\nThough you may claim false liberty, Satan is still your colonial master, and you are in bondage to him no matter the nature and level of your sin. Then the way out! I repeat again, and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free. It is the truth that saves and gives total liberation from sin. This can be yours this day as you recall those sins, relay them to the Saviour, request for cleansing through His blood and forgiveness for those sins, receive the Saviour into your heart and life, and promise to renounce those sins from your heart and life. I tell you, whether a sinner or backslider, as you appropriate this, you will experience true freedom from the colonial master.\n“If the Son, therefore, shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed”- John 8:36. He (Christ) has promised not just mere free but being free indeed! This freedom also include curses, ill luck, academic failure, spiritual setbacks, financial handicap, yokes, deliverance from all kinds of addictions, stagnancies, limitations, and lots more. Just come unto Jesus, and He will make you free indeed. Then, you can rejoice for the nations’ freedom as you jubilate yours also!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "I had an interesting experience today during my devotion. It never occurred to me that the Hebrew language is read from right to left (similar to Arabic). As I was reading the translation in English, it wasn’t making sense reading the transliteration from left to right until I became curious moving right and left to verses. Upon painstaking attentiveness, I caught that the best way to read it is right to left and not the other way around. I was wowed! as it began to make sense in reading. Swiftly, I headed to Google and as I began to type “is hebrew read”, autofill came handy “is hebrew read from right to left” and I clicked enter.\nOh mine! I learnt something new today."
