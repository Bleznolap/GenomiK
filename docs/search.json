    "text": "This is the first post in a Quarto blog. Welcome!\n\nI created this blog on the 8th of June 2024 (circa 2 AM) after ending a Monthly Friday vigil. I have had this thought of creating a blog during the week to express my thoughts about things, especially science. So, I got inspiration reading Meghan Hall’s post how she switched to Quarto. That’s how I read a few posts, including Philipp’s and watched a few YT videos on how to get started although I had once started a website with Quarto but abandoned it and I have a Google site website already. This is just for blogging and journaling."

    "text": "I had an interesting experience today during my devotion. It never occurred to me that the Hebrew language is read from right to left (similar to Arabic). As I was reading the translation in English, it wasn’t making sense reading the transliteration from left to right until I became curious moving right and left to verses. Upon painstaking attentiveness, I caught that the best way to read it is right to left and not the other way around. I was wowed! as it began to make sense in reading. Swiftly, I headed to Google and as I began to type “is hebrew read”, autofill cam handy “is hebrew read from right to left” and I clicked enter.\nOh mine! I learnt something new today."
