    "text": "This is the first post in a Quarto blog. Welcome!\n\nI created this blog on the 8th of June 2024 (circa 2 AM) after ending a Monthly Friday vigil. I have had this thought of creating a blog during the week to express my thoughts about things, especially science. So, I got inspiration reading Meghan Hall’s post how she switched to Quarto. That’s how I read a few posts, including Philipp’s and watched a few YT videos on how to get started although I had once started a website with Quarto but abandoned it and I have a Google site website already. This is just for blogging and journaling."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Independence! Independence!! Independence!!!. This day marks another epoch of national liberty in which the nationals rejoice in their freedom from their colonial master. When we talk about freedom, we mean total freedom. Consider an inmate who has stayed in the lock for decades and suddenly gains his freedom; you will say he is free because he will no longer remain in that bondage. Yes, as a nation, we’ve got freedom, but it is not total freedom. If you look well, you will see the total depravity and moral decadency around you with no law that firmly holds against them. Now to be specific, look at yourself, have you also gotten your freedom? I mean, are you free from sins? Has Christ’s atoning blood cleansed you from sins’ stains?. ‘And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free - John 8:32’. It is the truth that can make you free and not any ‘ritual’ or ‘ablution’. So as long as you commit sin, you are a servant of sin and colonized by sin.\nThough you may claim false liberty, Satan is still your colonial master, and you are in bondage to him no matter the nature and level of your sin. Then the way out! I repeat again, and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free. It is the truth that saves and gives total liberation from sin. This can be yours this day as you recall those sins, relay them to the Saviour, request for cleansing through His blood and forgiveness for those sins, receive the Saviour into your heart and life, and promise to renounce those sins from your heart and life. I tell you, whether a sinner or backslider, as you appropriate this, you will experience true freedom from the colonial master.\n“If the Son, therefore, shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed”- John 8:36. He (Christ) has promised not just mere free but being free indeed! This freedom also include curses, ill luck, academic failure, spiritual setbacks, financial handicap, yokes, deliverance from all kinds of addictions, stagnancies, limitations, and lots more. Just come unto Jesus, and He will make you free indeed. Then, you can rejoice for the nations’ freedom as you jubilate yours also!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "There is no leader without a follower but whosoever you follow is of a great concern. Who will I follow? Who is he that will be my master? Who will I serve? Who will I copy after?\nWhosoever you choose to follow is a concern because his nature will be in you and “it is enough for a servant to be as his master”. Critically considered, thoroughly thought, cost counted, and decision properly taken will determine who the master will be and whose lordship you will submit yourself to.\n“Multitude, multitude in the valley of decision” to know who their master will be. As I have said that it must be critically considered because to follow any master will require forsaking all I submit to his lordship, whatever he says unto me I will do and wherever he sends I will go without “ murmuring or disputing”; thoroughly thought will make you never to turn your back to the master when things are not going your way or his plans is always on the contrary to yours; cost being counted will make you to fully endure any hardship that will come your way as a result of your masters decision or rule that guides your life; and after all has been considered, proper decision will then be taken in terms of your choice of master.\nJesus was going around and saw two brothers and said unto them, follow me and on another time he saw two brothers with their father in a ship and said unto them, follow me. Another time, a man came to Jesus to speak a word of faith to his servant and after He saw his faith, He said to those that followed him,…. Have done good to show you those that have taken proper decision of whom their master will be, but what I learnt from that is, they left all and followed Him. Until you come to this state of leaving all, forsaking and wholly yielding to Christ call to follow Him, you are still in your self. Christ is calling you to follow His way, His life, His teaching, His style, His method and His all, be ready to follow without having any second thought because He is the Master that call His follower friend and not servant, He is the faithful Shepherd that cares for His sheep. Following Him will give you life eternal and no regret doing so.\nTo follow Him, you have to leave the life of sin you’re living in, the lifestyle that is not showing Gods glory and the activities that does not glorify God and forsake them once and all. Be ready to obey His Lordship, and where He leads, you go, and be resolute to let His word have the final say over all your endeavors, obey Him without complaining. Jesus is the only and faithful Master you can follow, follow Him!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "I had an interesting experience today during my devotion. It never occurred to me that the Hebrew language is read from right to left (similar to Arabic). As I was reading the translation in English, it wasn’t making sense reading the transliteration from left to right until I became curious moving right and left to verses. Upon painstaking attentiveness, I caught that the best way to read it is right to left and not the other way around. I was wowed! as it began to make sense in reading. Swiftly, I headed to Google and as I began to type “is hebrew read”, autofill came handy “is hebrew read from right to left” and I clicked enter.\nOh mine! I learnt something new today."
