I have an interesting experience today during my devotion. It never occurred to me that the hebrew language is read from left with right (similar to Arabic). As I was reading the translation in English langauag, it was'nt making sense reading the transliteration from left to right until I becam curious moving right and left to verse. Upon painstaking attentiveness, I caught that the best way to readit is right to left and no the other way round. Swifly I head to Google and as I began to type "is hebrew read", suggestions came up and I chose "is hebrew read from right to left".

Oh mine! i learnt something new today.
