        "I had an interesting experience today during my devotion. It never occurred to me that the Hebrew language is read from right to left (similar to Arabic). As I was reading the translation in English, it wasn't making sense reading the transliteration from left to right until I became curious moving right and left to verses. Upon painstaking attentiveness, I caught that the best way to read it is right to left and not the other way around. I was wowed! as it began to make sense in reading. Swiftly, I headed to Google and as I began to type \"is hebrew read\", autofill cam handy \"is hebrew read from right to left\" and I clicked enter.\n",
