        "I created this blog on the 8th of June 2024 (circa 2 AM) after ending a Monthly Friday vigil. I have had this thought of creating a blog during the week to express my thoughts about things, especially science. So, I got inspiration reading [Meghan Hall's post](https://meghan.rbind.io/blog/2024-02-11-moving-to-quarto/) how she switched to Quarto. That's how I read a few posts, including [Philipp's](https://www.philippkollenda.com/posts/qp2022-08-05_my-first-website/) and watched a few YT videos on how to get started although I had once started a website with Quarto but abandoned it and I have a Google site already. This is just for blogging and journaling.\n",
