There is no leader without a follower but whosoever you follow is of a great concern. Who will I follow? Who is he that will be my master? Who will I serve? Who will I copy after?

Whosoever you choose to follow is a concern because his nature will be in you and “**it is enough for a servant to be as his master**”. Critically considered, thoroughly thought, cost counted, and decision properly taken will determine who the master will be and whose lordship you will submit yourself to.

“*Multitude, multitude in the valley of decision*” to know who their master will be. As I have said that it must be critically considered because to follow any master will require forsaking all I submit to his lordship, whatever he says unto me I will do and wherever he sends I will go without “ murmuring or disputing”; thoroughly thought will make you never to turn your back to the master when things are not going your way or his plans is always on the contrary to yours; cost being counted will make you to fully endure any hardship that will come your way as a result of your masters decision or rule that guides your life; and after all has been considered, proper decision will then be taken in terms of your choice of master.

Jesus was going around and saw two brothers and said unto them, **follow me** and on another time he saw two brothers with their father in a ship and said unto them, follow me. Another time, a man came to Jesus to speak a word of faith to his servant and after He saw his faith, He said to those that followed him,.... Have done good to show you those that have taken proper decision of whom their master will be, but what I learnt from that is, they left all and followed Him. Until you come to this state of leaving all, forsaking and wholly yielding to Christ call to follow Him, you are still in your self. Christ is calling you to follow His way, His life, His teaching, His style, His method and His all, be ready to follow without having any second thought because He is the Master that call His follower friend and not servant, He is the faithful Shepherd that cares for His sheep. Following Him will give you life eternal and no regret doing so.

To follow Him, you have to leave the life of sin you’re living in, the lifestyle that is not showing Gods glory and the activities that does not glorify God and forsake them once and all. Be ready to obey His Lordship, and where He leads, you go, and be resolute to let His word have the final say over all your endeavors, obey Him without complaining. Jesus is the only and faithful Master you can follow, follow Him!
