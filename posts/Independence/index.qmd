Independence! Independence!! Independence!!!. This day marks another epoch of national liberty in which the nationals rejoice in their freedom from their colonial master. When we talk about freedom, we mean total freedom. Consider an inmate who has stayed in the lock for decades and suddenly gains his freedom; you will say he is free because he will no longer remain in that bondage. Yes, as a nation, we've got freedom, but it is not total freedom. If you look well, you will see the total depravity and moral decadency around you with no law that firmly holds against them. Now to be specific, look at yourself, have you also gotten your freedom? I mean, are you free from sins? Has Christ's atoning blood cleansed you from sins' stains?. ‘And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free - John 8:32’. It is the truth that can make you free and not any ‘ritual’ or ‘ablution’. So as long as you commit sin, you are a servant of sin and colonized by sin. 

Though you may claim false liberty, Satan is still your colonial master, and you are in bondage to him no matter the nature and level of your sin. Then the way out! I repeat again, and **ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free**. It is the **truth** that saves and gives total liberation from sin. This can be yours this day as you recall those sins, relay them to the Saviour, request for cleansing through His blood and forgiveness for those sins, receive the Saviour into your heart and life, and promise to renounce those sins from your heart and life. I tell you, whether a sinner or backslider, as you appropriate this, you will experience true freedom from the colonial master. 

"**If the Son, therefore, shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed**"- John 8:36. He (Christ) has promised not just mere free but being free indeed! This freedom also include curses, ill luck, academic failure, spiritual setbacks, financial handicap, yokes, deliverance from all kinds of addictions, stagnancies, limitations, and lots more. *Just come unto Jesus, and He will make you free indeed*. Then, you can rejoice for the nations' freedom as you jubilate yours also!
